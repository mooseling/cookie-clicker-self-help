I had a cookie clicker problem. I have, at long, long last, defeated it. Except for two achievements which seem very far out of reach.

Anyway, I am very much done playing now! Just putting down my remaining thoughts before I forget about all this.

Remaining ideas:
- Improve AutoGardener
    - Use rows of Nursetulips in the Golden Clover Strategy
    - Write a strategy to unlock all seeds
    - Switch to a click-boosting garden during big combos
- Optimise Wizard Tower number
    - We want 99 magic for casting Haggler's Charm as often as possible
    - But once a Click Frenzy is lined up, we want to keep building magic
- Improve logging
    - Logging is very annoying. Because every cycle checks the state of things and decides what to do, we sometimes log the same stuff repeatedly. We'd need to have a logger with state to avoid this, or have state in the main class.
- Use sugar lumps in End Game strategy
    - It's possible we could be lining up super massive combos. But they appear very rare to me. It's rare we even get a Builing Special and a Click Frenzy close together in Force the Hand of Fate.
